    "# Machine Learning vs. March Madness\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "Sports gambling is one of the fastest growing industries in the country, with states continuing to pass betting-friendly legislation and companies like DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM experiencing increased, year-over-year revenue. One of the premier sports betting events of the year is the NCAA college basketball postseason tournament, commonly known as *March Madness*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project posits that we run a sports gambling company. We offer our customers advisory services during the busiest time of the sports year on events with the greatest amount of betting action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We target college basketball because of our domain knowledge and the talent disparity within the sport. In professional sports, the talent gap between the best and worst teams is very small. It's unusual to see NBA spreads greater than 10 points. In college basketball, this happens regularly. Teams are 25-point underdogs on a given night and that creates betting value. There also tends to be more regular competition in college basketball. With only around 30 games in season, teams don't have the luxury to take nights off like we see in an 82-game NBA season. And with constant effort comes more predictable outcomes."

    "## Business Objective\n",
    "To maximize returns, we run a series of machine learning algorithms to model predictions for single games in the NCAA tournament. We pay particular focus to accurately predicting underdog team wins, as doing so yields higher payouts. Accuracy, and more specifically *predictive* accuracy, is paramount in selecting our models, as we strive to minimize risk for our customers."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "We set the win/loss outcome for the favored team as the binary target variable, with 1 equaling a win for the favored team and 0 equaling a win for the underdog. Rankings are assigned using the reputable KenPom ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use an iterative approach to build 6 predictive, classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging classifier and XGBoost. We utilize hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation and scoring to select the highest performing, predictive models. This approach is applied to regular season, postseason and cumulative postseason data."
